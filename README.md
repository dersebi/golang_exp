Clone of the Go exp package tree
================================

This repository was created, to enable the use of the exp package tree with go 1.
It will exist until there is an official fix from the Go team.

Just replace:

    import "exp/something"

with

    import "github.com/dersebi/golang_exp/exp/something"
